# recast.ly
Recast.ly is a React-based Youtube Video Player application for users to (live) search, watch, and save/organize youtube videos. Due to rate limiting of the free Youtube API this application uses a RESTful server to cache results from Youtube, allowing users to make more queries before hitting the daily limit.
